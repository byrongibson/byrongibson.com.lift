Description
-----------

A bare bones Lift 3.0-SNAPSHOT project template.  Nothing extra included.


Building
--------

This app requires sbt 0.12. To build for the first time, run:

    [shell]$ sbt
    > ~;container:start; container:reload /

That will start the app and automatically reload it whenever sources are modified. It will be running
on http://localhost:8080
